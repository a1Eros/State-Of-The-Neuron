Today, I created the State-Of-The-Neuron repository.
Purpose:
	*Track gains in conventional neural exercises (daily log function) as well as thoughts associated with my training sessions.
	*Document knowledge gained in the field of neuroscience, physiology, neuroenhancment, systems theory, cybernetics, information theory, phenomenology, etc. that will aid me in the process of maximizing the human intelligence quotient.
	*Report my innovations and inventions in the field of neuroenhancement
	*Report miscellaneous ideas connected to neuro-enhancement and its practical application

Today, I created the State-Of-The-Neuron repository at the urging of some friends.
The pruposes of this repository are as follows:
	*Track gains in conventional neural exercises (daily log function) as well as thoughts associated with my training sessions.
	*Document knowledge gained in the field of neuroscience, physiology, neuroenhancment, systems theory, cybernetics, information theory, phenomenology, etc. that will aid me in the process of maximizing the human intelligence quotient.
	*Report my innovations and inventions in the field of neuroenhancement
	*Report miscellaneous ideas connected to neuro-enhancement and its practical application

Dual N-back: Good progress in the positive direction. Moved from 5.20 to 5.56. I am pleased with how things are working and hope to reach D6B in the next 2-3 days. This seems more than feasible, though I am concenred that the way the d' system works, as it rewards very low progress for my liking. I will likely fork QuadBox tomorrow and fix gthe issue now that I've given its d' mode a chance - it has simply not satisfied. This, realistically, could drop me from the mid 5s to the low 5s, but studies have shown that an 85% accuracy range is the best for learning. Whether this applies to MET practice is uncertain, but probable (greater than two-thirds chance). I need to find the study and see if I can link it here tomorrow.

IMS: Some would say this is a questionable practice. These people do not include me in their ranks. Today, I managed to achieve my third day of 4k vision recorded. The colors were sharper, the patterns in everyday objects clearer, and small details more prominent. I will make a note that this effect is currently temporary, but, through consistent entrainment, I believe I can make it permanent. This synergizes well with my prject to develop ticker-tape synesthesia. Interestingly, this arose from a session where, due to mental fatigue caused by an improperly heavy meal (had missed all meals up to that point due to busy schedule), my focus was substandard. One change I did make this session, however, was that I consciously removed myself from the role of actor in the experience. Unlike most IMS sessions, "I" wasn't there except in the form of a polysensory organ (think a monocular, double-eared fingerless palm with a nose, a mouth, and telekinetic abilities). This depersonalization somehow links with the imagery to increase visual abilities. This is the effect I've noticed after stilling my thoughts, though amplified - somehow sense-perception is inversely proportionate to egoic perception. I am now increasingly inclined to take the Oneness experiences of mystics throughout all ages at face value. Same applies to hallucinogenics. It may be that the experience of the self carries a sclerotic bias that runs against neuroplasticity and must be removed for benefits to emerge. This may be doubly true in the realm of perception by reducing expectancy effects on what the brain processes. This is a potentially tremendous hypothesis/observation. By this alone, and all its future applications, I justify this day. 

Quad N-back: Gains were negative here. I went from 4.60 to 4.53 on the d' scaling system. I suspect this has to do with me placing the more demanding Quad after Dual N-back and IMS, meaning I used depleted energy to perform the task. After this experience, and a few more that have caused harm to my progress due to improper difficulty-ordering I'll maintain my regular regimen consisting of QnB, then DnB. Other exercises, IMS included, will have to be moved later. IMS will be perfomred after a meal, several hours all other exercise to permit glucose replenishment and cognitive rejuvenetion.

IMS: Thiry minutes. Minimal resolution change (2.5/10). Still a positive indication. Had 7.5 grams of Creapure creatine monohydrates before this to fuel my brain. Effect was not noticible. Will use 10 grams starting tomorrow.

QnB: 4.56 to 4.66. Not great, but I think I'm approaching my d'-adjusted limit, both here and in DnB. I didn't chaange the d' difficulty because I learned about the possible benefits of removing feedback. After I am done with this experiment, I'll create an 85% algorithm as previously discussed (to preserve variable integrity).

DnB: Some progress. Less than I wanted, unfortunately. 5.56 to 5.63, but, in part, this was due to me turning feedback for inputs off. This made me drop initially, but I still ended up gaining. I will keep feedback off for at least a week and observe how it goes.
